# __A course on applied data analytics for soil analysis with infrared spectroscopy__

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to a basic procedural workflow 
for analysing and predicting soil properties using visible, near-infrared (vis-NIR), 
and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. The workflow encompasses pre-processing 
techniques, variable selection methods, and predictive modelling approaches.

This repository makes use of a vis-NIR dataset comprising 300 soil 
samples collected from various locations across Europe.
